"""Re-align a wheel's METADATA / RECORD / dist-info dir to its filename.

Background
----------
A build step that injects a build timestamp into the wheel **filename**
(e.g. renaming
``databricks_labs_dqx_app-0.13.0.post38.dev0+65c9602-py3-none-any.whl``
to
``databricks_labs_dqx_app-0.13.0.post38.dev0+65c9602.post20260506102508-py3-none-any.whl``)
without also updating the wheel's internal ``METADATA``, ``RECORD`` or
``*.dist-info`` directory name produces a mismatched wheel.

The result is a wheel whose filename advertises a new version each
build but whose package metadata still reports the unchanged
git-derived version.  ``pip`` consults the metadata, sees the version
is already installed, and silently skips reinstall — so a Databricks
App container's persistent venv keeps running stale code on every
redeploy.

This script repairs such a wheel by:

1. parsing the version segment out of the filename
2. unpacking the wheel
3. renaming the ``*.dist-info`` directory to use that version
4. rewriting ``METADATA`` so ``Version:`` matches
5. regenerating ``RECORD`` checksums
6. repacking the wheel in place

After running this each rebuild produces a wheel with a unique
metadata version, forcing pip to install fresh code on every deploy.

Usage
-----
    python _align_wheel_version.py path/to/wheel.whl

The script overwrites the input wheel; safe to run idempotently.
