# Grant Unity Catalog permissions required after `databricks bundle deploy`.
#
# DABs creates schemas and volumes but cannot grant catalog-level access.
# This script discovers the app SP and job SP, then executes the necessary
# GRANT statements via the Statement Execution API.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/post_deploy_grants.sh -p <profile> [-t <bundle-target>] [-- <bundle-var-overrides...>]
#
# The bundle target is required when the bundle defines more than one
# target and none is marked as default. Without it, ``databricks bundle
# validate`` errors out and we have no way to discover the catalog name
# or job SP from variables.
#
# Everything after a ``--`` separator is forwarded to ``bundle validate``
# as extra ``--var key=value`` overrides. Pass the SAME overrides used
# at ``bundle deploy`` time — otherwise the script reads the default
# catalog/schema/volume names from the bundle and issues GRANTs on the
# wrong objects (the overridden resources receive no permissions and
# the app SP cannot read them).
#
# Requirements:
#   - databricks CLI authenticated
#   - jq installed
#   - The bundle must already be deployed (app and warehouse must exist)
