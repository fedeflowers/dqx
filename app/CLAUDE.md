# DQX Studio — CLAUDE.md

## Purpose

The DQX Studio is a **UI for authoring and managing data quality rules**. It lowers the barrier from writing code (YAML/Python) to a visual, self-service experience — making rule creation accessible to non-technical users while keeping technical users efficient.

**Scope:** Creating/validating rules, AI/profiler rule generation, rule lifecycle management, internal storage, approval workflows, export to execution systems, dry-run validation, scheduled in-app rule execution, run history + quality metrics + quarantine review.

**Not in scope:** Running rules as part of customer production data pipelines (the app's runs target dev/UAT data and write results to the app's own catalog).

## Deployment

- Deploys as a **Databricks App** (FastAPI backend + React frontend in a single Python wheel)
- Must be publishable to **Databricks Marketplace**
- Uses a **hybrid auth model**: data-plane reads (catalog/schema/table browse, dry-run preview, query execution against the user's tables) run as the logged-in user via **On-Behalf-Of (OBO)** tokens so Unity Catalog perms are enforced. Control-plane writes (rules CRUD, RBAC mappings, migrations, wheel sync, task-runner job submission) run as the app's **service principal** so they don't require every end user to hold those workspace permissions. See `README.md` for the full split.

## Target Personas

| Role | Description | Key Permissions |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `ADMIN` | Platform owner / data engineer | All permissions including configure storage, manage roles, approve rules, run rules |
| `RULE_APPROVER` | Reviews and approves rule submissions | View/create/edit/submit rules, approve/reject, configure storage, view quarantine |
| `RULE_AUTHOR` | Defines and maintains rules (data steward) | View/create/edit/submit rules, AI/profiler generation |
| `VIEWER` | Observability only | View rules |
| `RUNNER` *(orthogonal)* | Operator who triggers manual or scheduled runs | `run_rules` only — does not affect primary role; admins inherit it implicitly |

RBAC is enforced — routes use `require_role(*roles)` from `backend/dependencies.py` and roles resolve from Databricks workspace-group membership in `dq_role_mappings` (plus the bootstrap `DQX_ADMIN_GROUP`). See `backend/common/authorization.py`.

## Core User Journeys

1. **Business user generates rules via natural language** — select table → enter description → review AI candidates → optional dry-run → save
2. **Business user adjusts existing rules** — load → edit → optional dry-run → save (creates new version + approval request)
3. **Engineer reviews and approves rules** — review GUI/YAML → optional dry-run → configure checks storage → approve → export to Delta table
4. **Engineer generates rules via profiler** — select table → configure sampling → run profiler → review candidates → save
5. **Engineer pins a schema contract** — single-table editor → pick target table → add a `has_valid_schema` check → expected schema as DDL or reference table → strict/compatible mode → dry-run → save
6. **Data product owner imports rules** — Import rules page → pick **From DQX YAML** or **From data contract** tab → review preview → save drafts
7. **User browses and discovers rules** — filter by table/domain/owner/status → view versions → compare → import/export

### Synthetic FQN convention (`__sql_check__/<name>`)

Per-table rules carry a real `table_fqn`. **Cross-table SQL checks** are the only rules without a single home table, so they use the synthetic prefix `__sql_check__/<name>` and bucket under the **Cross-table rules** group in the UI catalog and edit-router. The runner reads their query body from `arguments.sql_query` and builds the input view from it (SQL fast-path, `is_sql_check=True`).

Reference checks such as `has_valid_schema` and `foreign_key` are **per-table** — they carry a real `table_fqn`, are authored/edited in the single-table editor, group under their target table, and run through the standard row-level engine via the normal `create_view(table_fqn)` path. They are *not* synthetic and need no special dispatch.

The cross-table dispatch lives in `backend/routes/v1/dryrun.py` and `backend/services/scheduler_service.py`. If you add another table-less rule kind, follow the synthetic-FQN convention and update both dispatchers in lock-step.

## Internal Storage

App uses a **hybrid backend** — analytical/append tables in Delta, OLTP
tables in Lakebase Postgres. Both backends are managed by their own
migration runner in `backend/migrations/`. Schemas, volume, and Lakebase
instance are declared as bundle resources in `databricks.yml` with
`lifecycle.prevent_destroy: true`, so `databricks bundle destroy` cannot
drop them — see "Bundle conventions" below. The app's `dqx_studio`
Postgres schema (inside the `databricks_postgres` admin database on the
Lakebase instance) is created at startup, not provisioned by the bundle,
but is protected transitively by the instance-level guard.

Lakebase instance (when enabled, default name = `dqx-studio-lakebase`):
 └── databricks_postgres              (database — always-present admin DB; no per-app DB provisioned)
     └── dqx_studio                   (schema — created by PgMigrationRunner on first start; configurable via DQX_LAKEBASE_SCHEMA)

         └── dq_migrations             (Postgres migration version tracker)
```

`(OLTP*)` = lives in **Lakebase Postgres** when
`lakebase_instance_name` is set, otherwise **Delta** (the
`v2: Delta OLTP fallback` migration).

## Key Decisions

- **No config.yaml** — all settings stored in Delta or Lakebase tables.
- **Dedicated catalog** — user selects at install; `dqx_studio` and `dqx_studio_tmp` schemas are declared as bundle resources and created by `databricks bundle deploy`.
- **Hybrid storage** — high-volume append tables in Delta; transactional/low-latency tables in Lakebase Postgres.
- **Rule promotion** — export rules then deploy separately to prod; or save directly to prod checks table.
- **Target environments** — Dev, UAT/QA (prod-like data); app is not intended for production rule execution.

## Bundle conventions

Stateful resources declared in `databricks.yml`:

- `resources.schemas.main_schema` — `dqx_studio` schema
- `resources.schemas.tmp_schema` — `dqx_studio_tmp` schema
- `resources.volumes.wheels` — wheels volume
- `resources.database_instances.lakebase` — Lakebase Postgres instance (autoscaling)

Each carries `lifecycle.prevent_destroy: true` (Databricks CLI 0.268+), which blocks `databricks bundle destroy` and any deploy that would force-replace the resource. To intentionally tear something down: drop the flag, `databricks bundle deployment unbind <key> -t <target>`, then destroy.

The app connects to the always-present `databricks_postgres` admin database on the Lakebase instance (set as the default `lakebase_database_name`) and creates its own `dqx_studio` Postgres schema there on first start. No DAB resource is needed to provision a per-app logical database; the bundle stays fully declarative. We deliberately do not use `database_catalogs` because it also creates a Unity Catalog catalog and therefore requires `CREATE CATALOG` on the metastore — a permission most app deployers don't hold.

For workspaces where the schemas / volume / Lakebase instance already exist (e.g. created out-of-band before this layout existed), run `make app-bind PROFILE=... TARGET=...` once per target to adopt them — otherwise `databricks bundle deploy` errors out with "already exists" / "Instance name is not unique".

Privileges on UC objects for the auto-created app SP are still reapplied with `scripts/post_deploy_grants.sh` after each deploy, because the app SP's UUID isn't known at bundle-write time.
