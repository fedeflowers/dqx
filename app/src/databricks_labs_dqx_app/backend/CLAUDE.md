# Backend — CLAUDE.md

## Overview

FastAPI REST API serving as the DQX Studio backend. Deployed as a **Databricks App** with On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication. Serves both API endpoints (`/api/v1/*`) and the compiled React frontend as static files.

## Key Patterns

### OBO + SP Authentication

User-facing operations run as the calling user via `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` (OBO).
Operations that need elevated permissions (catalog DDL, scheduler, migrations, job
submission) run as the app's service principal. Dependencies expose both:

```
get_obo_ws()              → WorkspaceClient(token=header_token, auth_type="pat")
  ├─ get_obo_sql_executor() → SqlExecutor on tmp schema (user permissions)
  ├─ get_view_service()     → user creates/drops their own temp views
  ├─ get_discovery_service()→ user-scoped UC browsing
  └─ get_user_catalog_names() → cached per token-hash, drives catalog filtering

get_sp_ws()               → WorkspaceClient() (SP credentials, cached 45 min)
  ├─ get_sp_sql_executor()  → SqlExecutor on main schema
  ├─ get_job_service()      → submits/polls task-runner job
  ├─ get_rules_catalog_service()
  ├─ get_role_service()
  └─ get_app_settings_service()
```

User identity comes from `X-Forwarded-Email`; the OBO `me()` SCIM call is the
fallback for local dev. `X-Forwarded-User` is **not** trusted (spoofable by upstream
proxies).

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Defined in `common/authorization.py`:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `ADMIN` | All actions, including configure storage, manage roles, approve rules |
| `RULE_APPROVER` | Create/edit rules, approve/reject submissions, configure storage, view quarantine |
| `RULE_AUTHOR` | Create/edit/submit rules, generate via AI/profiler |
| `VIEWER` | Read-only |

Roles resolve from Databricks workspace group membership in `dq_role_mappings`
(plus the bootstrap `DQX_ADMIN_GROUP`). `get_user_role` (in `dependencies.py`)
performs resolution and degrades gracefully to `VIEWER` if SCIM/role-mapping is
transiently unavailable.

Routes enforce roles via `require_role(*roles)` either on the router
(`APIRouter(dependencies=[require_role(...)])`) or per-route (`@router.get(..., dependencies=[require_role(...)])`).
Handler-level ownership checks (e.g. `cancel_dry_run`) supplement role guards
when a role alone isn't enough.

### Dependency Injection

All route handlers receive dependencies via `Annotated[T, Depends(get_T)]`. Dependencies are created per-request. Never instantiate services inline in route handlers.

### Async Pattern

Databricks SDK calls are synchronous. Wrap them with `asyncio.to_thread()` in service methods to avoid blocking the event loop. See `services/discovery.py` for the pattern.

### Route Conventions

```python
@router.get("/path", response_model=ResponseModel, operation_id="camelCaseId")
async def handler(dep: Annotated[Service, Depends(get_service)]) -> ResponseModel:
    ...
```

- All routes use Pydantic response models (type-safe serialization)
- `operation_id` is camelCase — orval uses it to generate frontend hook names
- Routes raise `HTTPException` with 401/403/404/400/500 as appropriate

### Config Serialization

Use `ConfigSerializer` from the DQX library to load/save workspace configs. Never use `dataclasses.asdict()`.

## Stack

- **FastAPI** ~0.119 (ASGI)
- **Pydantic** 2.11 (validation, settings, response models)
- **Databricks SDK** ~0.73 (workspace API)
- **Databricks Connect** ~15.4 (Spark sessions)
- **DQX library** (imported as `databricks-labs-dqx[llm]`)
- **Uvicorn** (ASGI server)
- **Python 3.11+**

## Commands

```bash
# From app/ directory
uv sync                    # Install dependencies
uv run uvicorn databricks_labs_dqx_app.backend.app:app --reload  # Dev server
```

## Adding a New Route

1. Create `routes/v1/<name>.py` with an `APIRouter(prefix="/<name>", tags=["<Name>"])`
2. Add route handlers with Pydantic response models and `operation_id`
3. Include the router in `routes/v1/__init__.py`
4. Add request/response models to `models.py`
5. Add any new dependencies to `dependencies.py`
6. Regenerate the OpenAPI spec so orval can update frontend hooks

## Adding a New Service

1. Create `services/<name>.py` with a class that accepts injected dependencies
2. Add a `get_<name>()` dependency function in `dependencies.py`
3. Wrap sync SDK calls with `asyncio.to_thread()` for async routes

## Important Notes

- **SQL safety:** all interpolated identifiers must pass `validate_fqn` and be wrapped with `quote_fqn` from `sql_utils.py`. All string literals must be escaped with `escape_sql_string` (ANSI doubled quotes — never backslash). User-supplied SQL bodies must pass `is_sql_query_safe()` from the DQX library and raise `UnsafeSqlQueryError` on rejection.
- **Migration startup:** SP authentication and `MigrationRunner.run_all()` are *required* — failure aborts the lifespan and the app refuses to start. Best-effort startup steps (tmp-schema creation, USE CATALOG grant, wheel sync) log warnings and continue.
- **Scheduler:** runs in-process as an asyncio task, gated by an exclusive file lock (`/tmp/.dqx_scheduler.lock`) so only one uvicorn worker drives it. Disable with `DQX_SCHEDULER_DISABLED=1`.
- **Caches:** `app_cache` (`cache.py`) is per-process in-memory with TTL. SP `WorkspaceClient`, OBO `WorkspaceClient`, and per-user catalog list are all cached. Use the `MISS` sentinel — never `is None` — to detect cache absence.
- **SPA static files:** `spa_static.py` falls through to `index.html` only for non-asset paths (positive allowlist of asset extensions), so SPA routes containing dots still work.
- **Synthetic-FQN dispatch (`__sql_check__/<name>`):** rules whose `table_fqn` starts with `__sql_check__/` are **cross-table SQL checks** — the only table-less rule kind. `arguments.sql_query` is set; build the input view with `view_svc.create_view_from_sql(...)` and set `is_sql_check=True`. A synthetic rule with no `sql_query` is malformed (surface a per-table error). Keep this dispatch in sync across `routes/v1/dryrun.py` (manual / batch) and `services/scheduler_service.py` (scheduled). Per-table errors raised during dispatch are surfaced to the UI via the run-submission response payload (consumed in `ui/routes/_sidebar/runs.tsx`). Reference checks like `has_valid_schema` / `foreign_key` carry a **real** `table_fqn` and flow through the normal `view_svc.create_view(table_fqn)` path (`is_sql_check=False`) — they need no special handling here.
- **Lakebase `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET` column references:** PostgreSQL refuses bare column references on the RHS of `DO UPDATE SET` (`column reference "version" is ambiguous`), and a *schema-qualified* reference (`"dq"."tbl"."version"`) is **not** a valid existing-row reference there either — Postgres treats it as a FROM-clause entry and errors with `invalid reference to FROM-clause entry for table "dq"` on the *first* save, not just on conflict. `PgExecutor.upsert_with_audit` therefore aliases the conflict target (`INSERT INTO <fqn> AS "dqx_upsert_target"`) and qualifies `increment_on_update` references against the alias (`"{qcol} = "dqx_upsert_target".{qcol} + 1"`). The regression test in `tests/test_pg_executor.py` asserts the alias form *and* the absence of both the bare and schema-qualified forms — do not relax it.

## Hybrid Storage Backend (Delta + Lakebase)

The DQX Studio data model is split across two physical backends and the
choice is driven entirely by `databricks.yml`:

| Backend | Tables | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Delta Lake** (always) | `dq_validation_runs`, `dq_profiling_results`, `dq_quarantine_records`, `dq_metrics` | Spark task runner writes these; high-volume append-mostly; columnar reads. |
| **Lakebase Postgres** *(default — opt-out via `lakebase_instance_name=""`)* | `dq_app_settings`, `dq_role_mappings`, `dq_quality_rules`, `dq_quality_rules_history`, `dq_comments`, `dq_schedule_configs`, `dq_schedule_configs_history`, `dq_schedule_runs` | Low-latency point reads/writes from FastAPI request handlers; row-level upserts; primary-key/foreign-key semantics. |

When Lakebase is **disabled** (no `lakebase_instance_name` set), the OLTP
tables fall back to Delta — `MigrationRunner` runs both
`v1: Delta analytical baseline` *and* `v2: Delta OLTP fallback`. When
Lakebase is **enabled**, only `v1` runs on Delta and `PgMigrationRunner`
provisions the OLTP tables in Postgres.

### Key types

- `SqlExecutor` (`sql_executor.py`) wraps the Databricks Statement
  Execution API for Delta.
- `PgExecutor` (`pg_executor.py`) wraps `psycopg` + a `psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool`
  for Lakebase. It mirrors `SqlExecutor`'s public surface: `execute`,
  `query`, `query_dicts`, `upsert`, plus the dialect helpers
  `q(identifier)`, `json_literal_expr(json_str)`, `ts_text(col)`. A
  background daemon thread refreshes the OAuth password every
  `DQX_LAKEBASE_TOKEN_REFRESH_MINUTES` minutes (default 50; tokens
  expire at 60). The pool's `kwargs["password"]` is mutated in place
  so subsequent connects pick up the new credential, and existing
  connections age out via `max_lifetime`.
- Services keep their `sql: SqlExecutor` annotation; the dependency
  injection layer (`dependencies.get_sp_oltp_executor`) hands back
  whichever executor is registered, casting to `SqlExecutor` because
  the two classes share an identical method surface.
- The `SchedulerService` accepts `oltp_sql: SqlExecutor | PgExecutor | None`
  and routes OLTP-table SQL (schedule configs, settings, rules) to
  the OLTP executor while keeping retention/GC against the Delta
  executor.

### Retention sweep (daily)

The scheduler runs a `DELETE` pass against the analytical tables once
per `_RETENTION_INTERVAL_HOURS` (24h). Two knobs, both stored in
`dq_app_settings` and surfaced via `GET/PUT /api/v1/config/retention`:

| Setting key                  | Default | Tables affected |
|------------------------------|--------:|-----------------|
| `retention_days`             | 90      | `dq_validation_runs`, `dq_profiling_results`, `dq_metrics`, plus the OLTP history tables (`dq_quality_rules_history`, `dq_schedule_configs_history`). Picked to match what trend dashboards expect. |
| `quarantine_retention_days`  | 30      | `dq_quarantine_records` only. Tighter because that table holds the full source row payload (PII surface). |

Both resolvers share a `_RETENTION_DAYS_MIN = 7` floor so a
mis-typed setting can never wipe data inside the safety window. Reads
swallow exceptions and fall back to the compiled-in default so a
SQL-warehouse hiccup never crashes the scheduler tick.

### Writing portable SQL inside services

Always go through the executor's dialect helpers — never hard-code
backticks, `parse_json(...)`, or `CAST(... AS STRING)`:

```python
self._sql.q("check")              # `check` (Delta) | "check" (Postgres)
self._sql.json_literal_expr(j)    # parse_json('...') | '...'::jsonb
self._sql.ts_text("created_at")   # CAST(created_at AS STRING) | created_at
```

For upserts, `SqlExecutor.upsert(table, key_cols, value_cols)` and
`PgExecutor.upsert` take the same arguments. Pass
`RawSql("current_timestamp()")` for timestamps — both backends rewrite
to their native syntax.

### Bundle / DAB conventions

Stateful resources declared in `databricks.yml` with
`lifecycle.prevent_destroy: true` (Databricks CLI 0.268+):

* `resources.schemas.main_schema` — `dqx_studio` schema
* `resources.schemas.tmp_schema` — `dqx_studio_tmp` schema
* `resources.volumes.wheels` — wheels volume
* `resources.database_instances.lakebase` — Lakebase Postgres instance
  (autoscaling by default per [Lakebase Autoscaling](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/oltp/upgrade-to-autoscaling))

The app connects to the always-present `databricks_postgres` admin
database on the Lakebase instance — that's the default value of
`lakebase_database_name` and the value the app→database binding
wires up. On first start, the app creates its own `dqx_studio`
Postgres schema inside `databricks_postgres` and runs migrations
against it. Multiple apps can therefore share the same
`databricks_postgres` on one Lakebase instance safely; each gets its
own schema namespace.

The bundle deliberately does NOT use `database_catalogs`. That DAB
resource is the only way to *create* a custom logical Postgres
database, but it also creates a Unity Catalog catalog as a side
effect and therefore requires `CREATE CATALOG` on the metastore — a
permission most app deployers don't hold. Connecting to the
pre-existing `databricks_postgres` instead keeps the bundle fully
declarative with no out-of-band bootstrap step and no metastore-level
permissions assumed.

`prevent_destroy` blocks `databricks bundle destroy` and any deploy
that would force-replace a bundle-managed resource — the alternative
is silent data loss. To intentionally tear one down: remove the flag,
run `databricks bundle deployment unbind <key>`, then destroy. The
app's `dqx_studio` Postgres schema lives below the resource layer
DABs models, so `prevent_destroy` doesn't apply to it directly; the
instance-level guard is what protects it.

For workspaces where the schemas, volume, or Lakebase instance were
provisioned out-of-band (e.g. by the legacy bootstrap script),
one-time binding is required: `make app-bind PROFILE=... TARGET=...`.
After bind, `bundle deploy` adopts the existing resources instead of
trying to CREATE them.

Privileges on UC objects for the auto-created app SP are still applied
by `scripts/post_deploy_grants.sh` after each deploy — the app SP's
UUID isn't known at bundle-write time.
