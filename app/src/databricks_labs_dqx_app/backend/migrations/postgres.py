"""Lakebase (Postgres) migration runner for DQX Studio OLTP tables.

The OLTP subset of the schema (rules catalog, app settings, RBAC,
comments, schedule configs, scheduler bookkeeping) lives in Lakebase
Postgres when ``conf.lakebase_enabled`` is true.  Append-mostly
analytical tables (``dq_validation_runs``, ``dq_profiling_results``,
``dq_metrics``, ``dq_quarantine_records``) stay in Delta because they
are written by the Spark task runner.

The runner mirrors :class:`backend.migrations.MigrationRunner` so the
operational story (versioned, idempotent, recorded in a
``dq_migrations`` meta table) is identical regardless of backend.

Schema mapping highlights
-------------------------
- Delta ``VARIANT`` (``check``, future blob columns) → Postgres
  ``JSONB``.  Both store JSON natively with predicate pushdown; JSONB
  also supports GIN indexes for low-latency lookups.
- Delta ``TIMESTAMP`` → Postgres ``TIMESTAMPTZ``.  Postgres'
  timezone-naive ``TIMESTAMP`` would silently drop offsets and break
  cross-region debugging.
- Delta ``BIGINT`` / ``INT`` / ``DOUBLE`` → ``BIGINT`` / ``INT`` /
  ``DOUBLE PRECISION`` respectively.
- Delta ``CLUSTER BY`` is not exposed; Postgres uses indexes
  declaratively where the access pattern justifies them.  Each table
  gets the small set of indexes the FastAPI services actually need.

Adding a new migration
----------------------
Append a new :class:`PgMigration` entry with the next monotonically
increasing version number.  Postgres supports ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD
COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` natively so re-running is safe out of the box.

# (the auto-committing :meth:`OltpExecutorProtocol.execute` would split
# them across separate transactions and leave the meta row out of sync
# on partial failure). Only :class:`PgExecutor` exposes that today —
# Delta runs through its own :class:`MigrationRunner` because Spark SQL
# DDL is not transactional anyway.
