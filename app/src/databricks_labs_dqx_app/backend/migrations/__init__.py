"""Database migration runner for DQX Studio (Delta).

Migrations are versioned DDL statements applied in order against the
configured Unity Catalog catalog/schema. The runner tracks every
applied version in a ``dq_migrations`` meta-table, so re-starting the
app never re-applies a migration that already succeeded.

Hybrid backend split
--------------------
The schema is delivered in **two parts** so the OLTP-style tables can
optionally live on Lakebase Postgres while the high-volume analytical
tables stay in Delta:

- **v1 — Delta analytical baseline** (always applied). Holds the
  Spark-written tables: ``dq_validation_runs``,
  ``dq_profiling_results``, ``dq_quarantine_records``,
  ``dq_metrics``.
- **v2 — Delta OLTP fallback** (only applied when Lakebase is
  disabled, i.e. ``include_oltp_fallback=True``). Holds the
  FastAPI-served tables: ``dq_app_settings``, ``dq_quality_rules``,
  ``dq_quality_rules_history``, ``dq_role_mappings``, ``dq_comments``,
  ``dq_schedule_configs``, ``dq_schedule_configs_history``,
  ``dq_schedule_runs``.

When Lakebase is enabled the same OLTP tables are created via
:mod:`backend.migrations.postgres` against the Postgres schema and v2
is skipped on the Delta side.

Atomicity model — Delta vs Postgres asymmetry
---------------------------------------------
The two backends have **different** failure-recovery semantics. Read
this before adding a new Delta migration:

- **Postgres path** (:mod:`backend.migrations.postgres`) — every DDL
  statement in a migration *and* the ``dq_migrations`` version-row
  ``INSERT`` execute inside a **single transaction** (``BEGIN`` …
  ``COMMIT``). If any statement fails the whole migration rolls back;
  the next run retries cleanly from the beginning.
- **Delta path** (this module) — the Databricks Statement Execution
  API auto-commits **per call**; there is no ``BEGIN``/``COMMIT``
  primitive for DDL on a SQL warehouse, so true atomicity is not
  available. A mid-migration failure therefore leaves earlier
  statements committed but the version row **uninserted**. Recovery
  relies on every DDL statement being individually re-runnable.

That recovery contract has three concrete invariants every Delta
migration author MUST satisfy:

1. **Idempotent DDL.** Use ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` and
   ``CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS``; never plain ``CREATE``. Plain
   ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`` and ``ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT`` are
   OK because their "already-exists" error fragments are swallowed
   (see ``_IDEMPOTENT_ERROR_FRAGMENTS``).
2. **Every "already exists" error a statement can raise must appear in
   ``_IDEMPOTENT_ERROR_FRAGMENTS``.** If you introduce a new DDL kind
   (``CREATE INDEX``, ``CREATE VIEW``, ``CREATE FUNCTION`` …) and
   half-applied recovery surfaces an unfamiliar error message, the
   migration becomes un-replayable in production until someone
   appends the fragment and ships a fix. Validate by checking the
   error catalog for the DDL kind you're adding.
3. **Template scanner invariants** — checked at module import by
   ``_validate_template_safe`` against every entry in :data:`MIGRATIONS`,
   so any violation crashes the app at boot rather than mid-deploy:

   - **No ``;`` inside a single-quoted string literal.** The runner
     splits compound migration bodies on ``;`` because the Statement
     Execution API only accepts one statement per call. A ``;``
     inside a CHECK constraint string, default value, or comment
     would split a statement mid-literal and silently corrupt it.
     If you ever genuinely need ``;`` in a literal, replace
     ``str.split(";")`` inside ``_apply`` with a real SQL statement
     splitter (e.g. ``sqlparse.split``).
   - **No ``{catalog}`` / ``{schema}`` placeholder inside a single-
     quoted string literal.** ``_apply`` substitutes the
     :meth:`SqlExecutor.q`-quoted form into these placeholders so
     hyphenated Databricks catalog names like ``prod-east`` parse
     correctly when used as object identifiers. The quoted form
     contains backticks, which would be nonsense inside a string
     literal. If you need the raw identifier inside a literal,
     introduce a separate placeholder rather than reusing
     ``{catalog}`` / ``{schema}``.

The Postgres runner does not need invariants 1 and 2 (the transaction
guarantees it) but does still split on ``;`` and so applies invariant 3
to its own templates.

Status casing convention
------------------------
Two status families intentionally use different casing:

- **Run-lifecycle** (``dq_validation_runs.status``,
  ``dq_profiling_results.status``) — UPPERCASE
  (``RUNNING``/``SUCCESS``/``FAILED``/``CANCELED``). These mirror the
  Databricks Jobs SDK ``life_cycle_state`` / ``result_state`` values
  that are passed straight through ``RunStatusOut`` to the frontend.
- **App-domain workflow** (``dq_quality_rules.status``,
  ``dq_schedule_runs.status``) — lowercase. These are pure DQX
  vocabulary (``draft``/``approved``, ``pending``/``partial_failure``)
  with no SDK counterpart.

CHECK constraints enforce the agreed values per domain — see each
table's ``chk_*_status`` constraint below.

Adding a new table or schema change after baseline
--------------------------------------------------
Append a new :class:`Migration` entry with the next monotonically
increasing version number. **Never edit or reorder existing entries.**
For column additions use ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`` (do *not* use
``ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` — it is not supported on all Databricks
SQL warehouse versions; ``_apply`` instead catches and tolerates
``COLUMN_ALREADY_EXISTS`` so re-running is safe).

If the change touches an OLTP table, mirror it in
:mod:`backend.migrations.postgres` so Lakebase deployments stay in
sync.

Upgrading an existing dev workspace
-----------------------------------
A workspace that previously ran the legacy migration sequence will have
``dq_migrations`` rows for versions that no longer exist, and tables
whose column types or constraints predate this baseline revision. The
cleanest path is::

    DROP SCHEMA <catalog>.<schema> CASCADE;

then redeploy — the consolidated baseline runs from scratch.

# Migration templates have two invariants that ``_apply`` relies on but
# the language doesn't enforce. ``_validate_template_safe`` checks both
# at module import time against every entry in :data:`MIGRATIONS` so a
# future author hits an :class:`AssertionError` on app boot instead of
# a half-applied or mis-quoted migration in production:
#
# 1. **No ``;`` inside a single-quoted string literal.**
#    ``_apply`` splits the template on ``;`` to feed one statement per
#    Statement Execution API call. A semicolon inside a string literal
#    would split the literal in half and corrupt both halves.
#
# 2. **No ``{catalog}`` or ``{schema}`` placeholder inside a single-
#    quoted string literal.** ``_apply`` substitutes the executor-
#    *quoted* form into those placeholders (so hyphenated catalogs like
#    ``prod-east`` parse correctly when used as identifiers). The
#    quoted form contains backticks, which would be nonsense inside a
#    string literal context. Today no migration uses placeholders in a
#    literal — this guard prevents a future author from introducing one
#    without adding a separate raw placeholder first.
#
# Doubled single-quotes (``''``) are the standard SQL escape for a
# literal apostrophe inside a single-quoted string; the scanner handles
# them correctly by keeping the in-literal flag set across the pair.

        Execution API auto-commits per call and there is no ``BEGIN``/
        ``COMMIT`` primitive for DDL on a SQL warehouse. A mid-migration
        failure therefore leaves earlier statements committed but the
        version row uninserted, and the next ``run_all`` re-runs the
        whole migration from the beginning.

        Recovery is safe **only** because every DDL kind we currently

        guarantees no template embeds a ``;`` inside a string literal,
        which would otherwise silently corrupt the split.

        characters outside ``[A-Za-z0-9_]`` (most commonly a hyphen
        in a Databricks catalog name) stay parseable. Placeholders
        are only used in object-name positions in the shipped
